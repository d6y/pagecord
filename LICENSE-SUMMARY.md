# Pagecord License Summary

This is a **human-readable summary** of the Pagecord License.  
It is not a substitute for the full legal terms in [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md).

---

## ✅ What you can do
- Run Pagecord for your **own personal or company blog**  
- Modify the code to suit your needs  
- Share your modified version (with notices of your changes)  
- Learn from the source and contribute improvements  

## ❌ What you cannot do
- Offer Pagecord as a **hosted or managed service** (e.g. a competing SaaS blogging platform)  
- Remove or obscure licensing, copyright, or trademark notices  

## ℹ️ Why this license?
Pagecord is meant to be free for personal use and self-hosting.  
But the hosted version at [pagecord.com](https://pagecord.com) is a paid SaaS business.  
This license protects against clones that undermine that business model.
