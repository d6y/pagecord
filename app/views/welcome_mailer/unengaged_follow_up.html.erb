<p>Hi there</p>

<p>
You signed up for Pagecord in <%= @blog.created_at.strftime("%B") %> but I noticed you haven't published any posts to your blog yet. I 
thought I'd check in personally to see if there's anything you need to get started?
</p>

<p>
Creating a post in Pagecord is as easy as sending an email from <%= @user.email %> to <%= mail_to @blog.delivery_email %>.
If you prefer, you can log in and use the rich text editor which now allows you to save draft posts too. 
</p>

<p>
People sometimes struggle with what to write about (me too!), but try not
to overthink it. Pagecord is really flexible — as well as long-form posts, you can post short updates like a photo from a recent trip, a link to an album you've discovered (Spotify, Apple Music and Bandcamp links <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/embed-spotify-and-youtube-content-in-your-posts-5f5e271">
  are automatically embedded</a>), or an interesting article you recently read. Kind of like you would with social media, but without the distraction!
</p>

<p>
If you're not ready to post, you can <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/pagecord-now-supports-pages">create a page</a> such as "About" or "Now" to share more 
about your blog, or what you’re working on. You can also <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/adding-social-links-to-your-blog">add social links</a> 
which appear as icons at the top of your blog.
</p>

<p>
I've added quite a lot of new features to Pagecord recently such as tags, blog language, themes, pages and private posts, 
and there are a couple of new things on the way! Stay tuned to <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com">the official blog</a> for
more news on that soon.
</p>

<p>
Don't hestitate to <a href="mailto:olly@pagecord.com">get in touch</a> if you have any feedback or questions. Until then, happy blogging!
</p>
