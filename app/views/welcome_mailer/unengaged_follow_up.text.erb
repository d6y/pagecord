Hi there

You signed up for Pagecord in <%= @blog.created_at.strftime("%B") %> but I noticed you haven't published any posts to your blog yet. I thought I'd check in personally to see if there's anything you need to get started?

Creating a post in Pagecord is as easy as sending an email from <%= @user.email %> to <%= @blog.delivery_email %>. If you prefer, you can log in and use the rich text editor which now allows you to save draft posts too. 

People sometimes struggle with what to write about (me too!), but try not to overthink it. Pagecord is really flexible — as well as long-form posts, you can post short updates like a photo from a recent trip, a link to an album you've discovered (Spotify, Apple Music and Bandcamp links are automatically embedded), or an interesting article you recently read. Kind of like you would with social media, but without the distraction!

If you're not ready to post, you can create a page such as "About" or "Now" to share more about your blog, or what you’re working on. You can also add social links which appear as icons at the top of your blog.

I've added quite a lot of new features to Pagecord recently such as tags, blog language, themes, pages and private posts, and there are a couple of new things on the way! Stay tuned to the official blog for
more news on that soon.

Don't hestitate to get in touch if you have any feedback or questions. Until then, happy blogging!
