  Hi ðŸ‘‹
</p>

<p>
  Just to let you know that your Pagecord subscription will renew automatically on <strong><%= @renewal_date.strftime("%B %-d, %Y") %></strong>.
</p>

<p>
  The annual fee of <strong>$<%= Subscription.price %></strong> will be charged to your card on this date, and you'll get another year of Pagecord Premium.
</p>

<p>
  If you'd like to update your payment method or cancel your subscription, log into Pagecord and visit the Billing page:
</p>

<p>
  <%= link_to app_settings_subscriptions_url, app_settings_subscriptions_url %>
</p>

<p>
  Thanks so much for being a Pagecord customer!
</p>
