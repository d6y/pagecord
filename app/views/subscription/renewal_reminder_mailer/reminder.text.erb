Hi ðŸ‘‹

Just to let you know that your Pagecord subscription will renew automatically on <%= @renewal_date.strftime("%B %-d, %Y") %>.

We'll charge our annual fee of $<%= Subscription.price %> to your card on this date to give you another year of Pagecord Premium.

If you'd like to update your payment method or cancel your subscription, log into Pagecord and visit the Billing page:

<%= app_settings_subscriptions_url %>

Thanks so much for being a Pagecord customer!

Olly
