  <h1 class="text-center">Frequently asked questions</h1>

  <h3>How does Pagecord work?</h3>
  <p>
    <%= link_to "Create an account", new_signup_path %> by choosing a username and supplying your email address. Once you verify
    your email, you'll receive a secret email address. Emails sent to this secret address from the email address you give us will
    appear as posts on your Pagecord page. If you prefer, you can log in to your account and create posts directly in the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your Pagecord page is a public profile that anyone can view. It looks like <a href="https://pagecord.com/pagecord">https://pagecord.com/pagecord</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Is there a way of creating posts without sending an email?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! Log into your account and click the <strong>New Post</strong> button to use our delightful in-app editor! ‚úçÔ∏è
  </p>

  <h3>Do I own the content that I post?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. As long as what you post is your own work, you own it (posting copyrighted material that you don't own <a href="https://pagecord.com/terms">is a no-no</a>). Pagecord does not claim ownership of any content you post.
  </p>

    Free customers can include a URL to an existing image (e.g. https://example.com/image.gif)

    free image hosting sites out there such as <a href="https://postimages.org/">PostImage</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I embed media?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! If you include a link to a YouTube video, a Spotify or Apple Music album/playlist/track, or a Bandcamp album/track in your email, Pagecord will
    embed the media in the post.
  </p>

    <%= link_to "Log in", login_path  %> and click the post title to edit the post.

  </p>

  <h3>Does Pagecord support RSS?</h3>
  <p>

  </p>

  <h3>Can I follow other accounts?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! If you're logged into your Pagecord account, you will see a "Follow" button when you view another
    Pagecord. You can view all the posts of the accounts you follow in the Feed section of your
    account.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also subscribe to someone's Pagecord by RSS (as well as your private feed). RSS is awesome, you should check out

  <h3 id="dns">How do I set up DNS for a custom domain?</h3>
  <p>
    If you're a paying customer, you can use your own domain name for your Pagecord. To host your Pagecord on a root domain
    (e.g. mydomain.com) you'll need to create the following DNS records:
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Record Type</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Content</th>
        <th>TTL</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>CNAME</td>
        <td><strong>@</strong></td>
        <td>proxy.pagecord.com</td>
        <td>3600</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CNAME</td>
        <td><strong>www</strong></td>
        <td>proxy.pagecord.com</td>
        <td>3600</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    If you want your Pagecord on subdomain (eg: https://blog.mydomain.com), you'll need to create the following DNS records instead:
  </p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Record Type</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Content</th>
        <th>TTL</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>CNAME</td>
        <td><strong>blog</strong></td>
        <td>proxy.pagecord.com</td>
        <td>3600</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    <em>Note: If you're using Cloudflare to manage DNS, you need to set SSL/TLS mode to <strong>Full (Strict)</strong> or disable the proxy (the orange cloud).</em>
  </p>

    been a subscriber for less than a month. No questions asked (although we'd love to know why you didn't like it).
  </p>

  <h3>Can I downgrade my account?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Cancel your subscription and once it lapses you'll be downgraded to a free account.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>
  <p>
    Log in, click the "Delete account" button at the bottom of the screen. This will
    display a confirmation, but once you confirm your account will be deleted immediatey.
