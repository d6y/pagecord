  <h3 id="how-does-pagecord-work" class="source-serif font-semibold text-2xl">How does Pagecord work?</h3>
  <p>
    <%= link_to "Create an account", new_signup_path, class: "home-link" %> by choosing a subdomain for your blog and supplying your email address. Once you verify
    your email, you'll receive a secret email address. Emails sent to this secret address from the email address you give us will
    appear as posts on your Pagecord page. If you prefer, you can log in to your account and create posts directly in the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your Pagecord page is a public profile that anyone can view. It looks like <a href="https://pagecord.com/blog" class="home-link">https://pagecord.com/blog</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yes. Just append <span class="font-mono">/feed.xml</span> on a blog's domain, e.g. <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/feed.xml" class="home-link">https://blog.pagecord.com/feed.xml</a>

  </p>

  <h3 id="dns" class="source-serif text-2xl font-semibold">How do I set up DNS for a custom domain?</h3>
  <p>
    If you're a paying customer, you can use your own domain name for your Pagecord. To host your Pagecord on a root domain
    (e.g. mydomain.com) you'll need to create the following DNS records:
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Record Type</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Content</th>
        <th>TTL</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>CNAME</td>
        <td><strong>@</strong></td>
        <td>proxy.pagecord.com</td>
        <td>3600</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CNAME</td>
        <td><strong>www</strong></td>
        <td>proxy.pagecord.com</td>
        <td>3600</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    If you want your Pagecord on subdomain (eg: https://blog.mydomain.com), you'll need to create the following DNS records instead:
  </p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Record Type</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Content</th>
        <th>TTL</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>CNAME</td>
        <td><strong>blog</strong></td>
        <td>proxy.pagecord.com</td>
        <td>3600</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    <em>Note: If you're using Cloudflare to manage DNS, you need to set SSL/TLS mode to <strong>Full (Strict)</strong> or disable the proxy (the orange cloud).</em>
  </p>

  <h3 id="subscribers" class="source-serif text-2xl font-semibold">How many people can subscribe to my email newsletter?</h3>
  <p>
    Pagecord Premium accounts include 100 email subscribers. If your blog is popular enough to need more than that, we can
    up your limit for an additional fee (currently $5/year for each additional 500 subscribers).
  </p>

  <h3 id="refund-policy" class="source-serif text-2xl font-semibold">What is your refund policy?</h3>
  <p>

    been a subscriber for less than a month. No questions asked (although we'd love to know why you didn't like it).
  </p>

  <h3 id="downgrade-account" class="source-serif text-2xl font-semibold">Can I downgrade my account?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Cancel your subscription and once it lapses you'll be downgraded to a free account.
  </p>

  <h3 id="delete-account" class="source-serif text-2xl font-semibold">How do I delete my account?</h3>
  <p>
    Log in, click the "Delete account" button at the bottom of the screen. This will
    display a confirmation, but once you confirm your account will be deleted immediatey.
  </p>

  <h3 id="data-storage" class="source-serif text-2xl font-semibold">Where is my data stored?</h3>
