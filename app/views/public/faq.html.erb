  <h3 class="source-serif text-2xl">How does Pagecord work?</h3>
  <p>
    <%= link_to "Create an account", new_signup_path %> by choosing a subdomain for your blog and supplying your email address. Once you verify
    your email, you'll receive a secret email address. Emails sent to this secret address from the email address you give us will
    appear as posts on your Pagecord page. If you prefer, you can log in to your account and create posts directly in the app.

  <h3 id="dns">How do I set up DNS for a custom domain?</h3>
  <p>
    If you're a paying customer, you can use your own domain name for your Pagecord. To host your Pagecord on a root domain
    (e.g. mydomain.com) you'll need to create the following DNS records:
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Record Type</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Content</th>
        <th>TTL</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>CNAME</td>
        <td><strong>@</strong></td>
        <td>proxy.pagecord.com</td>
        <td>3600</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CNAME</td>
        <td><strong>www</strong></td>
        <td>proxy.pagecord.com</td>
        <td>3600</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    If you want your Pagecord on subdomain (eg: https://blog.mydomain.com), you'll need to create the following DNS records instead:
  </p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Record Type</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Content</th>
        <th>TTL</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>CNAME</td>
        <td><strong>blog</strong></td>
        <td>proxy.pagecord.com</td>
        <td>3600</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    <em>Note: If you're using Cloudflare to manage DNS, you need to set SSL/TLS mode to <strong>Full (Strict)</strong> or disable the proxy (the orange cloud).</em>
  </p>

  <h3 id="subscribers">How many people can subscribe to my email newsletter?</h3>
  <p>
    Pagecord Premium accounts include 100 email subscribers. If your blog is popular enough to need more than that, we can
    up your limit for an additional fee (currently $5/year for each additional 500 subscribers).
  </p>

  <h3 class="source-serif text-2xl">What is your refund policy?</h3>
  <p>
    If you've paid for an account and you decide you're unhappy with it, we'll refund your money if you've
    been a subscriber for less than a month. No questions asked (although we'd love to know why you didn't like it).
  </p>

  <h3 class="source-serif text-2xl">Can I downgrade my account?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Cancel your subscription and once it lapses you'll be downgraded to a free account.
  </p>

  <h3 class="source-serif text-2xl">How do I delete my account?</h3>
