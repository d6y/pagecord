# Pagecord Contributions

Pagecord isn't currently accepting contributions. The code is shared for curious minds.

Issues can be raised of course, thank you.

At some I'd like to find one or two contributors to help out, especially with the hosting side of things. They would need to be active users and supporters of the product.

## Support the project

Using Pagecord and buying a premium subscription is the obvious way to help out, and would be very much appreciated.

Or you can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/heyolly) if you like! ☕️😊

Also, if there are any generous souls out there wishing to help out with hosting please do get in touch!
